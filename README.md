- Added SQL code for database, also added "dummy" values in for testing of PHP and HTML code once we get to that point (sometime before Thursday)
- IMPORTANT NOTE: database should be named preptastic so PHP code works properly

My goals for before Thursday (probably sometime this weekend):
- Figure out some basic PHP code for one of the pages (probably the recipe page)
- Check SRS and SDD document for any missing requirements that need to be implemented still and haven't been claimed already
- Do help page
