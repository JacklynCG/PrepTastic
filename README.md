# PrepTastic
Meal prep project 


Maggie April 17th:
I am going to try and get the recipes all done by thursday April 24th, my goals:

1. First and foremost we need the front end to be done by thursday:
    - Navbar
    - icon
    - Pages structure: The same formatting (margins padding), colors, fonts, on all pages

2. What I am going to focus on: the recipes -
    - Recipe Cards: can expand and subtract, will have image, title, ingredients, step-by-steps
    - Buttons for adding to meal, saving, creating, etc. These dont need to be done by thursday because the posting action is somthing
    that will be done in php/backend and however having their presence is needed
    - Creating a recipe: When the create recipe button is clicked the template will load which will allow a user to 
    upload an image, add a title, description, step-by-step, ingredients, and then buttons at the bottom "create." When that button is clicked
    it should save automatically to the recipe page. I believe this is doable for this week, however the php for adding it to meals, and posting it to the "public" feed might not be done yet

So because we are going to be showing the front end on thursday (and he wanted a little bit of php), my goal this week is to finish
the design of Recipe page and the Feed page. Since the php will not be done in time I am going to hard code some recipes into the feed, and into the saved recipe pages so that they are not empty. What will be interactble will be the "creating recipe" feature. I want to have it so that the user input saves and does post to their personal page when they are done creating it. 

The TODOS for after the week:
- Add to meal functionality
- Posting to the "public" feed
- Saving recipes from the "public" feed
- Remove from favorites
- Remove from meal
